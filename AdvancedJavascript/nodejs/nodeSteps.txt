STEP 1 – INSTALL NODE.JS
	http://nodejs.org/
	
	
	Node was installed at

   		/usr/local/bin/node

	npm was installed at
	
	   /usr/local/bin/npm
	
	Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH.
	


STEP 2 – INSTALL EXPRESS

Framework that takes Node from a barebones application and turns it 
into something that behaves more like the web servers.
This installs some core Express functionality right into our Node installation, making it available globally 
	
	C:\node>npm install -g express



STEP 3 – CREATE AN EXPRESS PROJECT

We're going to use Express and Jade

	express --sessions nodetest1
	
	
STEP 4 – EDIT DEPENDENCIES

	open package.json
	
	"dependencies": {
		"express": "3.4.4",
		"jade": "*",
		"mongodb": "*",
		"monk": "*"
	}
	
STEP 5 – INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

	cd to your nodetest1 directory
	
	npm install
	
	test at nodetest1>node app.js then localhost:3000
	
	
STEP 6 - OPEN APP.JS
