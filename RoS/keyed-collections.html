        /*
        
        The keys of an Object are Strings, where they can be of any value for a Map.
        
You can get the size of a Map easily while you have to manually keep track of size for an Object.
The iteration of maps is in insertion order of the elements.
An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map. (this can be bypassed using map = Object.create(null)).

Use maps over objects when keys are unknown until run time, and when all keys are the same type and all values are the same type.
Use maps in case if there is a need to store primitive values as keys because object treats each key as a string whether it's a number value, boolean value or any other primitive value.
Use objects when there is logic that operates on individual elements.

        /*
        Checking whether an element exists in a collection using indexOf for arrays is slow.
Set objects let you delete elements by their value. With an array you would have to splice based on an element's index.
The value NaN cannot be found with indexOf in an array.
Set objects store unique values; you don't have to keep track of duplicates by yourself.
