                Shared state is any variable, object, or memory space that exists in a shared scope, or as the property of an object being passed between scopes.
                        
                The problem with shared state is that in order to understand the effects of a function, you have to know the entire history of every shared variable that the function uses or affects.

                Imagine you have a user object which needs saving. Your saveUser() function makes a request to an API on the server. While thatâ€™s happening, the user changes their profile picture with updateAvatar() and triggers another saveUser() request. On save, the server sends back a canonical user object that should replace whatever is in memory in order to sync up with changes that happen on the server or in response to other API calls. 
                
                
                  Another common problem associated with shared state is that changing the order in which functions are called can cause a cascade of failures because functions which act on shared state are timing dependent:      
                        */




        // With shared state, the order in which function calls are made
        // changes the result of the function calls.
        const x = {
            val: 2
        };

        const x1 = () => x.val += 1;

        const x2 = () => x.val *= 2;

        x1();
        x2();

        console.log(x.val); // 6

        // This example is exactly equivalent to the above, except...
        const y = {
            val: 2
        };

        const y1 = () => y.val += 1;

        const y2 = () => y.val *= 2;

        // ...the order of the function calls is reversed...
        y2();
        y1();

        // ... which changes the resulting value:
        console.log(y.val); // 5




        //---------------------------------------------------
        //        const x = {
        //            val: 2
        //        };
        //
        //        const x1 = x => Object.assign({}, x, {
        //            val: x.val + 1
        //        });
        //
        //        const x2 = x => Object.assign({}, x, {
        //            val: x.val * 2
        //        });
        //
        //        console.log(x1(x2(x)).val); // 5  //this is the key point

        //        const y = {
        //            val: 2
        //        };
        //
        //        // Since there are no dependencies on outside variables,
        //        // we don't need different functions to operate on different
        //        // variables.

        //
        //
        //        // Because the functions don't mutate, you can call these
        //        // functions as many times as you want, in any order, 
        //        // without changing the result of other function calls.
        //        x2(y);
        //        x1(y);
        //
        //        console.log(x1(x2(y)).val); // 5  //this is the key point
